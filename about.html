    <h1>RIE FOSHEE</h1>


    <h2>who is she?</h2>
    <p>
      Rie is a performance artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sometimes does unexpected things in public places as a way of exploring themes and concepts that are interesting or intriguing to her. She crafts her life as a piece of art itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small>(More specifically, Rie is the performance artist persona of real-life person <a target="_blank" href="http://mariechatfield.com">Marie Chatfield</a>.)</small>
    </p>


    <h2>where is she?</h2>
    <p>
      When Rie inhabits her corporeal existence, she can usually be found in California.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small>(Otherwise, she exists mostly -- but not exclusively -- inside the imagination of Marie.)</small>
    </p>


    <h2>what are her pronouns?</h2>
    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="http://her.pronoun.is/she/her">her.prounoun.is/she/her</a>, thank you for asking!
    </p>
    <p>
      <small>(These also happen to be Marie's pronouns, for the record.)</small>
    </p>


    <h2>i don't get it</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever wanted to be someone else for a day?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever spontaneously given a different name when you order a coffee, just to try it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever worn a costume or an outfit that's normally not your style, and felt like a slightly different person?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered what it might be like if you had been born with a different name, or used a nickname, or didn't use a nickname?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever been too afraid to do something because it doesn't fit your understanding of who you are?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are the kinds of questions that Rie is interested in exploring. Rie's life and the presentation of her personality are themselves an art process and exploration, a smaller-scale version of the navigation of self we all do on a daily basis. Rie is just a bit more intentional about that process, since she's not a full-time identity.
    </p>
     <p>
      <small>(Also, Marie is really amused by the meta-ness of the performance of a performance-artist persona as a piece of art itself.)</small>
